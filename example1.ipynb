    "\n",
    "1. Positive: Reviews discussing good service or tasty food.\n",
    "2. Negative: Reviews expressing dissatisfaction with dirty conditions or tasteless food.\n",
    "3. Neutral: Comments addressing non-related issues not specifically related to food taste or conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset: The data span a period of more than 15 years, including all ~20,000 reviews. There are almost 45 restaurant reviews.\n",

    "Expected Outcomes: By the end of this notebook, we aim to have a trained and validated model capable of accurately classifying user reviews into the specified categories. This information will provide valuable insights into the overall food quality perception of McDonald's (US) stores and help identify areas for improvement.\n",
