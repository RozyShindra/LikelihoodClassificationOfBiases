    "**Yelp Online Review Classification: Identifying Positive, Negative, and Neutral Comments on Food and Restraunt Quality**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Positive: Reviews discussing good service or tasty food.\n",
    "2. Negative: Reviews expressing dissatisfaction with dirty conditions or tasteless food.\n",
    "3. Neutral: Comments addressing non-related issues not specifically related to food taste or conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset: The data span a period of more than 15 years, including all ~20,000 reviews. There are almost 45 restaurant reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Outcomes: By the end of this notebook, we aim to have a trained and validated model capable of accurately classifying user reviews into the specified categories. This information will provide valuable insights into the overall food quality perception of McDonald's (US) stores and help identify areas for improvement.\n",

      "The doughnuts are pretty good The chocolate milk was so disgusting I don't think it's worth the hype.\n",
      "Great donut place walking distance from Freemont experience. Huge fresh donuts. We went on Sunday at 930 and they had plenty to choose from.\n",
      "The donuts were good but there is no sitting area. I little disappointed drove from San Diego to try it.\n",
      "Lost count how many times we've been here. Never disappoint. French toast donut lifer. Too bad this one doesn't have beer like the other.\n",
