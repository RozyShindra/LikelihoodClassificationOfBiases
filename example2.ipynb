    "1. Electronic/Computer Products: Reviews discussing or concerning electronic or computer-related products available on Amazon.\n",
    "2. Clothing/Fashion-Related Products: Reviews discussing or concerning products related to various fashionwear available on Amazon.\n",
    "3. Neutral: Comments addressing non-related issues not specifically related to any of the above categories.\n",

    "Dataset: The dataset used for this analysis will consist of user reviews from Amazon's online platform. It will contain text data along with corresponding labels indicating the topic category (electronic/computer, clothing/fashionwear, or neutral).\n",

    "Expected Outcomes: By the end of this notebook, we aim to have a trained and validated model capable of accurately classifying user reviews into the specified categories. This information will provide valuable insights into the customer preferences and sentiments towards electronic/computer products and clothing/fashion products on Amazon's platform.\n",
