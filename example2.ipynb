    "Expected Outcomes: By the end of this notebook, we aim to have a trained and validated model capable of accurately classifying user reviews into the specified categories. This information will provide valuable insights into the customer preferences and sentiments towards electronic/computer products and clothing/fashion products on Amazon's platform.\n",
